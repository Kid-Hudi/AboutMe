    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p> I am a leader, learner and a techie! <br> 
        I have spent my career thus far trying to best understand and meet customer needs. <br>
         I have spent the last several years working with the same mission in mind but doing so by managing a growing team of 10. In these years I have scaled a client success program from working with 1000 new clients a year to one that will service more than 2400 clients this year; all while creating amazing experiences and meeting company goals. I am always learning and growing and I want to use my talents and experience to help you do exactly that... GROW!
